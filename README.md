My name is Lexi and I am 24 years old, working as a manufacturing engineer for a medical device company. I am a very active person who practices Taekwondo, plays volleyball multiple times a week, and plays kickball in an organized league. I am a huge sports fan that will never pass up the opportunity to watch a Formula 1 race, Chicago Cubs, Bears, or Blackhawks game.
